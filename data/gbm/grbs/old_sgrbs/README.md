# GBM Data: Short GRBs

This directory contains the information needed to download the Fermi-GBM triggers used to produce the source inputs found in `MEGAlib_source_inputs/grbs/old-sgrbs`, by running `download_gbm_data.py` with the corresponding .yaml file.          

`download_gbm_sgrbs.yaml`: All Fermi-GBM triggers with T90 < 2.5 s. Used to create the inputs found in `MEGAlib_source_inputs/grbs/old_sgrbs/sgrbs/`, which includes GRBs that occured up to December 7, 2023.           
`download_gbm_sgrbs_0.yaml`: All Fermi-GBM triggers with T90 < 2.0 s. Used to create the inputs found in `MEGAlib_source_inputs/grbs/old_sgrbs/sgrbs_0/`, which includes GRBs that occured up to October 31, 2023.
