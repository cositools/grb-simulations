# GBM Data: Long GRBs

This directory contains the information needed to download the Fermi-GBM triggers used to produce the source inputs found in `MEGAlib_source_inputs/grbs/data-challenge-3`, by running `download_gbm_data.py` with the corresponding .yaml file.          

`download_gbm_lgrbs.yaml`: All Fermi-GBM triggers with 2.0 < T90 < 100.0 s. A random subset of these was used to create the inputs found in `MEGAlib_source_inputs/grbs/data-challenge-3/`, which includes GRBs that occured up to August 5, 2024.
