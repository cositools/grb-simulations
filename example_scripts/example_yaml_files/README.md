`example_source_file.yaml` is a sample .yaml file used as input for `sample_source_file_generation.py`. When `sample_source_file_generation.py` is run, it takes spectral (.yaml & .dat) and lightcurve (.dat) files from the directory specified in the input .yaml file (`example.yaml`) and writes the spectral info from the spectrum .yaml file (if spectrum_type: 'yaml') or the path to the .dat file into the MEGAlib .source file (spectrum_type: 'dat'), as well as the path to the lightcurve .dat file.      
Parameters to be defined in the .yaml file:

The `example-spectraltype_spectrum.yaml` files are examples of each of the MEGAlib spectral models supported by `sample_source_file_generation.py`: monoenergetic, Band function, Comptonized, power law, and broken power law. The parameters needed depend on the model. These files must end in '_spectrum.yaml' and be located in the `input_path/` directory indicated in the input .yaml file when running `source_file_generation.py`.      

`example_spectrum.dat` is a sample spectral .dat file which can be used in place of the .yaml files. This allows for custom spectral shapes to be used instead of the built in MEGAlib functions. Only the shape is important, not the amplitude, since the flux is defined in the .source file. These files must end in '_spectrum.dat' and be located in the `input_path/` directory indicated in the input .yaml file when running `source_file_generation.py`.      

`example_lightcurve.dat` is a sample lightcurve file. Only the shape is important, not the amplitude, since the flux is defined in the .source file. These files must end in '_lightcurve.dat' and be located in the `input_path/` directory indicated in the input .yaml file when running `source_file_generation.py`.
