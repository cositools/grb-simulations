# Data Challenge 3 Spectra and Lightcurves

This directory contains the long GRB spectra and lightcurves created by Eliza and provided for Data Challenge 3. They are downloaded from Fermi-GBM, and the lightcurves were binned using Bayesian blocks. GRBs with T90 > 2.0 & < 100.0 s and Band function best spectral fits are included, and the energy range for the spectral .yaml files is 100-10000 keV.
