# Data Challenge 3 Spectra and Lightcurves

This directory contains the long GRB spectra and lightcurves created by Eliza and provided for Data Challenge 3. They are downloaded from Fermi-GBM, and the lightcurves were binned using Bayesian blocks. GRBs with T90 > 2.0 & < 100.0 s and Band function best spectral fits are included, and the energy range for the spectral .yaml files is 100-10000 keV. The polarization fractions are 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90%, with randomly selected polarization angles. Flux values were chosen such that some GRBs have a minimum detectable polarization (MDP) below their polarization fraction, and some have an MDP above.
