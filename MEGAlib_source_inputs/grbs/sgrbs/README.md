# Spectra and Lightcurves

This directory contains spectra and lightcurves of the Fermi-GBM data found in `/Users/eneights/work/COSI/grb-simulations/gbm_data/sgrbs/`. The lightcurves and spectra were binned using Bayesian blocks. The energy range for the spectral .yaml files is 10-10000 keV. Only GRBs with Band and Comptonized best spectral fits are included.
